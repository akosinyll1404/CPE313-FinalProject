# YOLOv11-Based Employee Activity Classifier

A Streamlit web application using a custom-trained YOLOv11 model (`best_path.pt`) to classify employee states as **"working"** or **"not working"** from uploaded images and videos. This project leverages computer vision to support real-time monitoring of workplace activity and well-being.

## 📌 Project Objective

Maintaining employee satisfaction and productivity is essential to organizational success. Traditional monitoring methods often lack real-time responsiveness. This system introduces an AI-powered approach to detect anomalies in employee behavior, enabling proactive support and creating a more responsive and employee-centric work environment.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real-time classification of uploaded images and videos  
- 📷 Detects "working" vs. "not working" states based on activity and facial expression  
- 🖥️ Simple, interactive Streamlit interface  
- 🧠 Powered by a custom YOLOv11 model (`best_path.pt`)

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-activity-classifier.git
   cd employee-activity-classifier
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or manually install:

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit torch torchvision opencv-python pillow
   ```

3. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 📷 Usage

* Upload an image or video file via the Streamlit interface.
* The model will process the file and display predictions.
* Results are visualized with annotated bounding boxes and labels.

## 🧠 Model

The model is a custom YOLOv11 object detector trained to distinguish between working and non-working states based on employee posture, gestures, and facial cues.
